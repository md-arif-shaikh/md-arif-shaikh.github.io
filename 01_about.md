I'm an assistant professor of Physics at [Vivekananda Satavarshiki
Mahavidyalaya](https://www.vsm.org.in/) (affiliated to Vidyasagar University),
West Bengal, India.

I was a postdoctoral research scholar at the [Seoul National
University](https://en.snu.ac.kr) in Seoul, South Korea from july 2022 to
November 2023. I worked in Prof [Hyung Mok
Lee](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~hmlee/)'s group in the department of [physics and
astronomy](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en). Before that, I was a postdoctoral
fellow in the [Astrophysical
Relativity](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel) group at
[ICTS-TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in/) from 2019-2022 and worked with Prof
[Parameswaran Ajith](https://home.icts.res.in/~ajith/Home.html).

I got my MSc (2014) and PhD (2019 with Prof [Tapas Kumar
Das](http://www.hri.res.in/~tapas/)) in Physics from
[HRI](https://www.hri.res.in/), India, and did my BSc (2012) at [Jadavpur
University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/) in Kolkata.

My primary research interest is gravitational wave physics and astronomy. I am
a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/) and
[Simulating eXtreme Spacetime](https://www.black-holes.org/) Collaboration.
