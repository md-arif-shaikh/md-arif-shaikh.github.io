After about 3 years (July 02, 2019 - June 28, 2022) of staying as a postdoctoral Fellow at 
the [International Centre for Theoretical Scineces](https://www.icts.res.in/) (ICTS), Bengaluru,
I am moving to a new postdoc position in the [Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://astro.snu.ac.kr)
at [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) (SNU).

I want to thank all the members of the [Astrorel](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel) group at
ICTS for making these three years full of learning experience. Special thanks to prof
[Parameswaran Ajith](https://home.icts.res.in/~ajith/), Dr Prayush Kumar and Prof Bala Iyer. I would also
like to thank Dr Shasvath Kapadia (now an assistant professor at IUCAA) with whom I had the opportunity to
collaborate and learn a lot during these three years.

At SNU, I will be working with Prof [Hyung Mok Lee](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~hmlee/)
starting from July 19, 2022.
