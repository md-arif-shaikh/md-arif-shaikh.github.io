The [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) package
[soccer](https://github.com/md-arif-shaikh/soccer) is a useful tool for
accessing information on major soccer leagues in Europe, including fixtures,
results, and tables. With the package, users can easily add upcoming fixtures
to their `org-agenda` and integrate them with other schedules.

To add upcoming fixtures to your org-agenda, simply call `soccer-schedule`
using the `M-x` command and select the desired league and club. You can also
specify the number of weeks' worth of fixtures to add in the same call. This
streamlined process allows for seamless integration of soccer fixtures with
other personal and professional schedules and deadlines.
