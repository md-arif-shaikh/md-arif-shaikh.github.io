Last October, I visited Prof. Hyung Mok Lee at SNU, Seoul, to deliver
a talk titled "What Do We Know About the Eccentricity of GW Sources?"
at a one-day workshop, "Cosmology in the Multi-Messenger Era." This
visit came almost a year after I left the gravitational wave group at
SNU to join my current institute.

Prof. Hyung Mok was kind enough to support my travel and stay during
this visit. While it provided another opportunity to connect with
people in and around Seoul, it was also a chance to enjoy the beauty
of autumn colors in the city.

Despite my busy and packed schedule, I managed to find some time to
visit the coastal town of Yangyang on Korea’s east coast. The main
attraction was the beautiful Naksan Temple. It was a one-day trip from
Seoul by bus. Since I hadn’t prebooked my tickets and most of them
were sold out, I took a bus that departed from Seoul around 2 PM and
managed to get a return ticket on the last bus from Yangyang to
Seoul. I arrived in Seoul past midnight and took a cab to my hotel
near Guro Digital Complex subway station.

The day before my departure, one of my colleagues at SNU, Nicolas, and
I went on a hike to see a castle just outside Seoul.

It was quite a busy trip in terms of work. Nevertheless, it was great
to visit Seoul, especially during this time of year.
