I joined Prof. [Hyung Mok Lee](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~hmlee/)'s group in the
[Department of Physics and Astronomy](http://astro2.snu.ac.kr/e_main.php) at
[Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/) (SNU) in July 2022, and it's
already time to say goodbye. I will be leaving my current position on November
5, 2023.

First and foremost, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to
Prof. [Hyung Mok Lee](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~hmlee/) for his exceptional
kindness and generosity throughout my stay. I had numerous opportunities to
collaborate with groups and participate in meetings all around the world.

I also want to extend my thanks to all my colleagues in the gravitational wave
group at SNU and at the [Center for the GW
Universe](https://gwuniverse.snu.ac.kr/). It has been a wonderful journey
living in Korea, and I hope to return in the near future as a visitor. Thank
you for making my time at SNU so memorable.
