LVK Collaboration is going to organize its [September
meeting](https://www.resceu.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/symposium/LVK2023toyama/index.php)
from September 11-15, 2023, in Toyama, Japan. Although I have been a member of
the collaboration for the past few years, due to the Covid-19 pandemic and some
personal constraints, I only attended the meeting remotely. This will be the
first time I will attend in person. Eagerly waiting to meet many familiar
collaborators from all around the world and discuss exciting physics using
gravitational waves.
