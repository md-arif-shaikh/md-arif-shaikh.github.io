I will be participating in the 2023 Fall meeting of the [Korean Astronomical
Society](http://www.kas.org/) scheduled to take place at Ramada Plaza, Jeju,
Korea, from October 18 to October 20, 2023.

This marks my second attendance at the KAS meeting, and it's particularly
exciting to have the event hosted in the beautiful location of Jeju. I'm
eagerly anticipating reconnecting with familiar faces from the Korean
Astronomical Society.

Jeju, situated in the southern region of Korea, is a renowned tourist
destination known for its captivating beauty. Amid the conference, I'm hoping
to set aside some time to explore the island's attractions before heading back
to Seoul.
