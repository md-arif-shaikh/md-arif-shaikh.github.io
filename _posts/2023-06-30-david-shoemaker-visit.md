Prof [David Shoemaker] visited our group at SNU. Prof [David Shoemaker] led the
advanced LIGO Project that enabled the [first
detection](https://www.ligo.org/detections/GW150914.php) of gravitational wave
in September of 2015 and also was a spokesperson of the LIGO Scientific
Collaboration from 2017-2019.

Today Prof [David Shoemaker] joined our group in an exciting discussion on the
future gravitational wave detectors - including LISA, Cosmic Explorer and
Einstein Telescope. We got many interesting insights on the Advanced LIGO
project as well as an idea of the challenges that lies ahead in the future
gravitational detectors.
