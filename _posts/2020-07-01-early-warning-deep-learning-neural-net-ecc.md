#### Abstract
We present the ﬁrst application of deep learning forecasting for binary neutron stars, neutron star–black hole
systems, and binary black hole mergers that span an eccentricity range $e \leq 0.9$. We train neural networks that
describe these astrophysical populations, and then test their performance by injecting simulated eccentric signals in
advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) noise available at the Gravitational Wave
Open Science Center to (1) quantify how fast neural networks identify these signals before the binary components
merge; (2) quantify how accurately neural networks estimate the time to merger once gravitational waves are
identiﬁed; and (3) estimate the time-dependent sky localization of these events from early detection to merger. Our
ﬁndings show that deep learning can identify eccentric signals from a few seconds (for binary black holes) up to
tens of seconds (for binary neutron stars) prior to merger. A quantized version of our neural networks achieves
4× reduction in model size, and up to 2.5× inference speedup. These novel algorithms may be used to facilitate
time-sensitive multimessenger astrophysics observations of compact binaries in dense stellar environments.
