Center for Gravitational Wave Universe
([GWUniverse](https://gwuniverse.snu.ac.kr/)) is organizing Winter
Workshop-2023, February
26 - March 1, 2023, at Yongpyong Resort, Pyeongchang, Gwangwon-Province, Korea.

It is the first time a meeting is being held entirely in person after the
Covid-19 started and allows the members of the group to know each other and
their work. Each member is presenting a short talk on the current work/idea
they are pursuing.

The venue of the meeting is a beautiful ski resort that hosted the winter
Olympics in 2018. It is very well connected to Seoul by train. KTX connects
from Seoul to Jinbu and from there the hotel provides bus service to the
hotel. The total journey takes about three and a half hours.
