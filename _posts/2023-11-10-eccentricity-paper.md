Our paper on defining eccentricity for gravitational wave astronomy is now
published in Physical Review D.

#### Abstract
Eccentric compact binary mergers are significant scientific targets for current
and future gravitational wave observatories. To detect and analyze eccentric
signals, there is an increasing effort to develop waveform models, numerical
relativity simulations, and parameter estimation frameworks for eccentric
binaries. Unfortunately, current models and simulations use different internal
parametrizations of eccentricity in the absence of a unique natural definition
of eccentricity in general relativity, which can result in incompatible
eccentricity measurements. In this paper, we adopt a standardized definition of
eccentricity and mean anomaly based solely on waveform quantities and make our
implementation publicly available through an easy-to-use python package,
gw_eccentricity. This definition is free of gauge ambiguities, has the correct
Newtonian limit, and can be applied as a postprocessing step when comparing
eccentricity measurements from different models. This standardization puts all
models and simulations on the same footing and enables direct comparisons
between eccentricity estimates from gravitational wave observations and
astrophysical predictions. We demonstrate the applicability of this definition
and the robustness of our implementation for waveforms of different origins,
including post-Newtonian theory, effective-one-body, extreme mass ratio
inspirals, and numerical relativity simulations. We focus on binaries without
spin precession in this work, but possible generalizations to spin-precessing
binaries are discussed.
