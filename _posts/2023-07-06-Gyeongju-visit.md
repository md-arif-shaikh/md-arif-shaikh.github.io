{{site.data.conference-talks["icgac15-2023"].from-year}}. Gyeongju is a city filled with old relics and history from the Silla dynasty that ruled Korea for about a thousand years from 57 BCE to 935 CE. The capital of the Silla dynasty is now a UNESCO world heritage city.

# How to reach there
Travelling in Korea is very easy. I took the KTX train from Seoul to SinGyeongju. It took about two hours. From SinGyeongju station there are frequent buses to the Gyeongju city which takes less than half an hour. However, since the conference was at the Kolon Hotel, which is a little far and located near the southeastern part of Gyeongju, I just took a cab. Gyeongju is very close to Busan and can be reached by either KTX or bus very easily.

# Where did I go in Gyeongju
- **[Bulguksa temple](https://english.visitkorea.or.kr/svc/contents/contentsView.do?vcontsId=94395&menuSn=351):** Very close to Kolon Hotel and reachable by Bus No 10 or 11 from the city. It is said to be one of the most sacred Buddhist temples in Korea. There are a lot of places to eat here. Cafes and convenience stores are there if you need something.
