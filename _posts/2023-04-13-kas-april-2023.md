Attending the 2023 Spring meeting of the [Korean Astronomical
Society](http://www.kas.org/) from April 12 - April 14, 2023, at Lahan Hotel,
Jeonju, Korea.

It is the first of the two annual meetings organized by KAS. The other one is
usually held in the Fall. While most speakers give their talk in Korean
(although the slides are in English which I can follow), there are few sessions
where the presentations are in English. For example, the talks in the the
Cosmology & Dark Energy session is mostly in English.

The meeting place, Jeonju, is a beautiful city. Behind the meeting venue is a
Hanok village, a very famous attraction for tourists. I found the streets of
this village filled with both Korean and foreign tourists dressed in
traditional Korean attires.
