A new paper lead by Susovan Maity at [Harish-Chandra Research Institute](https://www.hri.res.in) on Carter-Penrose diagrams
for emergent spacetime around accreting Kerr black holes is now accepter in the Phys. Rev. D for publication.

#### Abstract
In this work, we construct and study the Carter-Penrose diagram for sonic black hole and white hole analogues as manifested in
the analogue spacetime embedded inside the flow of hydrodynamic inviscid matter onto astrophysical rotating black holes.
For general relativistic black hole accretion in the Kerr metric, we show that linear perturbation of the axially symmetric
matter flow having certain geometrical configurations leads to the emergence of black hole like acoustic spacetime.
Such an analogue spacetime is shown to be endowed with one white hole like sonic horizon flanked by two black hole like
acoustic horizons. We construct the compactified causal structures, i.e., the Carter Penrose diagrams for such emergent
spacetime to study the corresponding horizon effects. For the first time in literature, the Carter Penrose formalism is carried
out for analogue spacetime embedded within a natural large scale fluid flow under the influence of strong gravity.
