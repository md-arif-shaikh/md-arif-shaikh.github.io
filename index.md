Hi! Welcome to my webpage. I'm Md Arif Shaikh <span lang="bn">(মহঃ আরিফ শেখ)</span>. I'm a postdoc at the [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr), Seoul, South Korea and I work on gravitational wave physics, waveform modeling and numerical relativity.

I'm a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/) (LSC) and the [Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org/).
