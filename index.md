Hi! Welcome to my webpage. I'm Md Arif Shaikh (মহঃ আরিফ শেখ). I'm a postdoc at the [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in), Bengaluru, India and I work on gravitational wave physics, waveform modeling and numerical relativity.

I'm a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/) (LSC) and the LIGO-India Scientific Collaboration (LISC). I am also a member of the [Simulating eXtreme Spacetime (SXS) Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org/).
