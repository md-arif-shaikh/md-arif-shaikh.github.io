I'm a postdoctoral research scholar at the [Seoul National
University](https://en.snu.ac.kr) in Seoul, South Korea. I work in Prof [Hyung
Mok Lee](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~hmlee/)'s group in the department of [physics
and astronomy](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en).

I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Astrophysical
Relativity](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel) group at
[ICTS-TIFR](https://www.icts.res.in/) from 2019-2022. I got my MSc (2014) and PhD (2019) in
Physics from [HRI](https://www.hri.res.in/), India, and did my BSc (2012) at
[Jadavpur University](https://jadavpuruniversity.in/) in Kolkata.

My primary research interest is gravitational wave physics and astronomy. I am
a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/) and
[Simulating eXtreme Spacetime](https://www.black-holes.org/) Collaboration.
