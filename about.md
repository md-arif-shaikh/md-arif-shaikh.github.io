I'm a postdoctoral research scholar at the [Seoul National
University](https://en.snu.ac.kr) in Seoul, South Korea. I work in Prof [Hyung
Mok Lee](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~hmlee/)'s group in the department of [physics
and astronomy](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en).

# Research Interests
I work on different aspects of gravitational-wave (GW) physics including 
  - Modeling of eccentric waveform using Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole mergers
  - Studying implications of higher modes of GW in improving parameter estimation and early-warning of black hole-neutron star mergers
  - Testing General Theory of Relativity using GW
  - Gravitational lensing of GW

Currently, I'm a member of the [LIGO Scientific
Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/)(LSC) and the [SXS
Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org/). [Here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link

# Journey so far
I was born in a rural village in Murshidabad, about 200 km north of
Kolkata. After the completion of my primary education, I joined Al-Ameen
Mission, a residential school located in South Dinajpur and completed the
secondary examination (10th) conducted by the West Bengal Board of Secondary
Education in 2007 with the 1st rank among about 0.7 million candidates.

After completing the higher secondary examination (10+2) in 2009, I joined
[Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), Kolkata for Bachelor of
Science in Physics and completed in 2012.

After my graduation from [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), I
had several offers including [IIT Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), [IISc
Bangalore](https://iisc.ac.in/), [IUCAA Pune](https://www.iucaa.in/en/) and
[NCRA-TIFR](http://www.ncra.tifr.res.in/ncra/main) Pune, to pursue
Masters/Integrated PhD in Physics.  I decided to join [Harish-Chandra Research
Institute](http://www.hri.res.in), a premier institute for Theoretical Physics
and Mathematics and completed my PhD in 2019 under the supervision of Prof
[Tapas Kumar Das](http://www.hri.res.in/~tapas/). During my PhD, I mostly
worked on the stability of stationary black hole accretion solution and the
emergence of the so-called analogue gravity phenomenon in such a system.

After my PhD, I wanted to change my field of research to work on gravitational
wave physics and joined [International Centre for Theoretical
Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) in Bangalore as a postdoctoral fellow where
I worked with Prof [Parameswaran
Ajith](https://home.icts.res.in/~ajith/Home.html) and Dr [Prayush
Kumar](https://www.icts.res.in/people/prayush-kumar) as a member of the
[Astrophysical Relativity Group](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel).

# Other interests
I am an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) enthusiast. In my spare times, I like to write `Emacs-Lisp` to configure Emacs as well as write packages for Emacs. You can find Emacs packages that I have written on my Github [md-arif-shaikh](https://github.com/md-arif-shaikh).
