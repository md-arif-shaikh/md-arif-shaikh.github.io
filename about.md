I'm a postdoctoral research scholar at the [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr), Seoul, South Korea. I work in Prof [Hyung Mok Lee](http://astro.snu.ac.kr/~hmlee/)'s group in the department of [physics and astronomy](https://physics.snu.ac.kr/en).

I work on different aspects of gravitational-wave (GW) physics including 
  - Modeling of eccentric waveform using Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations of binary black hole mergers
  - Studying implications of higher modes of GW in improving parameter estimation and early-warning of black hole-neutron star mergers
  - Testing General Theory of Relativity using GW
  - Gravitational lensing of GW

Currently, I'm a member of the [LIGO Scientific Collaboration](https://www.ligo.org/)(LSC) and the LIGO-India Scientific Collaboration(LISC) the [SXS Collaboration](https://www.black-holes.org/). [Here]({{site.baseurl}}{% link collaborators.md %}) is an incomplete list of my collaborators.

From 2019 to 2022, I was a postdoctoral fellow at [International Centre for Theoretical Sciences](https://www.icts.res.in/) where I worked with Prof [Parameswaran Ajith](https://home.icts.res.in/~ajith/Home.html) and Dr [Prayush Kumar](https://www.icts.res.in/people/prayush-kumar) as a member of the [Astrophysical Relativity Group](https://www.icts.res.in/research/astrorel).

From 2012 to 2019, I was an Integrated PhD student at [Harish-Chandra Research Institute](http://www.hri.res.in) where I worked with Prof [Tapas Kumar Das](http://www.hri.res.in/~tapas/) mainly on the stability of stationary black hole accretion solution and the emergence of the so-called analogue gravity phenomenon in such a system.

I completed my Bachelor of Science in Physics at [Jadavpur University](http://www.jaduniv.edu.in/), Kolkata in 2012.

I am an [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) enthusiast. In my spare times, I like to write `Emacs-Lisp` to configure Emacs as well as write packages for Emacs. You can find Emacs packages that I have written on my Github [md-arif-shaikh](https://github.com/md-arif-shaikh).
