    <h3> <u>Defining eccentricity for GW Astronomy</u> </h3>
    <p> Defines a standard framework for measuring eccentricity in
    gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, along with methods to calculate
    eccentricity directly from gravitational waveforms.
    </p>

    <p> In General Theory of Relativity, there is no unique way to
    define the eccentricity of a binary system's orbit. This can lead
    to ambiguity about the binary's eccentricity inferred from GW
    observations. In our works, we propose a standardized definion
    that relies solely on the gravitational waveforms, removing gauge
    ambiguity and model dependence. This standardized definion can be
    used to measure eccentricity from gravitational waveform emitted
    by binaries on generic bound orbits.
    </p>
    
    <p> A Python implementation of the method is available on GitHub:

    <h3> <u>IMRCT meets eccentricity</u> </h3>
    <p>The Inspiral-Merger-Ringdown Consistency Test (IMRCT) is a key
    tool for testing the validity of General Relativity (GR) using
    gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by compact binary
    systems. However, the use of quasicircular templates in the IMRCT
    analysis of signals from binaries on eccentric orbits can lead to
    false indications of GR violations.</p>

    <p>This study demonstrates that adopting templates accounting for
    orbital eccentricity eliminates such spurious violations,
    emphasizing the critical need for accurate eccentric templates in
    gravitational wave astronomy. These findings highlight the
    importance of template accuracy in ensuring robust GR 
    tests, particularly for eccentric binary systems.</p>

    <h3> <u>Fast and accurate microlensing template via surrogate
    modeling</u></h3> 
    <p>This study focuses on modeling the gravitational microlensing
    effect on gravitational waves (GWs) produced by different lens
    configurations.</p>

    <p>The microlensing effect is computed via a numerically expensive
    integration, making the generation of templates required for
    gravitational wave (GW) data analysis prohibitive. We circumvent
    this challenge by applying surrogate modeling techniques. The
    surrogate model enables fast and accurate generation of
    microlensed GW templates, making parameter estimation from GW
    observations feasible.
    </p>

    <h3> <u>Probing the nature of black holes using microlensing of
    GWs</u></h3>
    <p>The research highlights the potential of gravitational wave
    microlensing as a tool to probe the properties and nature of the
    lens, offering new insights into the nature of the lens black
    hole.</p>
