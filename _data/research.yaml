    <p> Defines a standard framework for measuring eccentricity in
    gravitational wave (GW) astronomy, along with methods to calculate
    eccentricity directly from gravitational waveforms.

    <p> In General Theory of Relativity, there is no unique way to
    define the eccentricity of a binary system's orbit. This can lead
    to ambiguity about the binary's eccentricity inferred from GW
    observations. In our works, we propose a standardized definion
    that relies solely on the gravitational waveforms, removing gauge
    ambiguity and model dependence. This standardized definion can be
    used to measure eccentricity from gravitational waveform emitted
    by binaries on generic bound orbits.

    <p> A Python implementation of the method is available on GitHub:

  summary: |
    <p>The Inspiral-Merger-Ringdown Consistency Test (IMRCT) is a key
    tool for testing the validity of General Relativity (GR) using
    gravitational waves (GWs) emitted by compact binary
    systems. We extend this test to GW signals from eccentric binaries.</p>
  full-text: |
    <h3> <u>IMRCT meets eccentricity</u> </h3>
    <p>The IMRCT is usually peformed using quasicircular template
    which assumes the binary's orbit to be circular. We first show
    that using quasicircular template for IMRCT on eccentric signals
    may lead to false violation of GR. We then show that when the
    IMRCT is peformed using eccentric template such spurious violation
    of GR goes away. This emphasises the need for using eccentric
    templates when analysing GW data and peforming test of GR using GW
    observations.

  summary: |
    We build fast and accurate surrogate model of microlensed
    gravitational wave, and probe nature of the lens using
    gravitational wave observations.
  full-text: |
    <h3> <u>Fast and accurate microlensing template via surrogate
    modeling</u></h3> 
    <p>This study focuses on modeling the gravitational microlensing
    effect on gravitational waves (GWs) produced by different lens
    configurations.</p>
    <p>The microlensing effect is computed via a numerically expensive
    integration, making the generation of templates required for
    gravitational wave (GW) data analysis prohibitive. We circumvent
    this challenge by applying surrogate modeling techniques. The
    surrogate model enables fast and accurate generation of
    microlensed GW templates, making parameter estimation from GW
    observations feasible.

    <h3> <u>Probing the nature of black holes using microlensing of
    GWs</u></h3>
    <p>The research highlights the potential of gravitational wave
    microlensing as a tool to probe the properties and nature of the
    lens, offering new insights into the nature of the lens black
    hole.</p>
